## Idle

Getting ready to fire fireballs. Just a short pause, giving the player time to position themselves before he fires.

## Firing

Firing a series of fireballs in a spiral formation, then a short cooldown period.

## Teleport Out

The ogre becomes invisible, and stays invisible for a second.

## Teleport In

The ogre teleports to one of the 3 other platforms. Whilst the ogre is fading in he doesn't hurt the player, but also he can't be hurt himself.
